Move Color and Chat formatting stuff to the Kyori Adventure API. Will require a change in StarCore though (This supports 1.8 to 1.21.1)
Maybe use ProtocolLib?
Add logging - Channels, Rooms and PMs
Cross Server Communication - BungeeCord (Also when the Java Socket based api is implemented, do it this way as well)
Add Discord Hook - Need a bot based api for plugins
Add Symbol Shortcuts for Channels (Like the Nexus Reborn @ for staff chat)
Hover and Click Event support and formatting (Requires adventure API change)
Chat Filtering (Spam, caps, adverts)
Broadcasting
Mute chat
Interactive placeholders like [item], pos, other things, make configurable/expandable
Custom placeholders
Social spy like feature (/peek?)
Chat room overhaul 
Menus
Join/Quit? Maybe
Mentions
Rank based formatting 
PM toggling 
Ignore/block
Per world rooms
Per Group Rooms
World Guard support?
Towny Support?
Factions Support?
Range based chat - either based on sender pos or an anchor
